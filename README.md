# ENG 1044 Research Paper Portfolio

This portfolio contains all the behind-the-scenes of the research paper. This includes the drafts for the research paper, reflections after having written the research paper, the roadmap, the planning for this portfolio website, etc.

The portfolio was decided to be coded instead of using a platform like Google Sites, Wix, WordPress, etc. purely for the enjoyment of the process of developing a website.

# Reasons for SvelteKit

Due to deadline, something familiar needed to be used and therefore, SvelteKit was chosen. However, for a website like this, it is actually more suitable to use a static site generator (SSG) like [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) or [Astro](https://astro.build).

# Getting Started

If you want to contribute to the code and aren't familiar with SvelteKit, here are some steps to get you started on how to use SvelteKit.

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npm create svelte@latest

# create a new project in my-app
npm create svelte@latest my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
