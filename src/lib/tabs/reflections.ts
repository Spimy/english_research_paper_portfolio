					'During the research process of writing this paper, there have been a few roadblocks that required me to find alternative solutions. One such roadblock was the lack of resources for the chosen topic due to its nicheness. Whether it is the Sunway Library, or even Google Scholar, there is a lack of materials required for our research. Moreover, when resources are found on Google Scholar, but are locked behind a paywall, there were occasions where Sunway Library was not able to procure the documents required. This required me, and my group members, to be creative, using some articles of other but similar topics, and infer details from them to link to our own paper.',
					'The most fun part during this coursework for me is the process of working on the portfolio. Differing from the norm, as I enjoy coding, we have decided to code the entire portfolio, from scratch, without using any third-party tools / website builders such as Canva or Wix. This gave us freedom on the portfolio design which allowed us to tie it to the theme of our research paper even more closely than what website builders provide with their templates. The most challenging part of coding the portfolio is the implementation of the gacha animation for the roadmap page. Since none of the group members know how to draw, having the chest animated in 2D was not feasible. Instead, we have opted for a 3D chest instead, modelled in Blender. This also gave me the opportunity to try out a new library, Three.js, which I have never used before to render 3D objects on a webpage.',
					"This coursework was also a good opportunity for group work, allowing me to develop my collaborative work soft skill which is essential  in today's competitive job hunts. The workload shared across group members was well balanced and realistic, reflecting real world work division. Furthermore, balancing the workload while keeping track of time in mind has helped in developing time management skills to always keep up with not only the official deadline set for the assignment, but also personal (and group) deadlines as well.",
					'Overall, my experience with this coursework has been a positive one: it was not only productive, but also fun to work on. It helped me to gain, develop and improve the skillsets required in my field of study. While reading and writing research papers may not be a day-to-day job for someone in the field of software, reading and writing is a crucial skill required by software engineers when it comes to software documentations. Thus, I think this course work was well required.'

					'When we started this coursework, we had difficulty choosing between three niche topics. Subsequently, this created another issue of accessibility of research articles. All group members were able to find adequate research information but were limited by paywalled publishers inaccessible by the Sunway Library. However, we overcame this obstacle by delving deeper into attaining vital information from other subsidiary peer-reviewed articles based on meta-analytic studies of gambling, gambling law, and online betting and its effect on youth.',
					'Furthermore, I was tasked to write 2 sections of our 6-section research paper which included the introduction and the third supporting argument. The introduction was time-consuming as I had to build my understanding of the history of gambling and present issues regarding youth. Nonetheless, it allowed me to establish a firm thesis statement. Additionally, research into the marketing of online gambling (OG) and its ramifications on youth (the third argument) was demanding as all relevant research was limited to qualitative studies and few accurate quantitative studies. However, piecing together different articles and website statistics allowed for a valid and stimulating argument.',
					"Additionally, this assignment allowed me to fully embrace a project-based learning mentality. I initially thought that working in a group was going to be a challenging obstacle. However, my group and I quickly realised that successful and detailed delegation of tasks was at the forefront of creating a mindful and elaborate piece of coursework. We took the initiative to meet periodically to review each other's tasks and discuss future modifications.",
					"Moreover, we decided to take a different approach to how we displayed our portfolio by coding a website. One group member was tasked with coding the website as he has the most experience in web development. The second group member and I were tasked to create designs for each part of the website. We namely focused on colour palettes, theme allocation, layout, and font. I enjoyed the creative aspect of it as I found ways to learn and utilise resources in conglomeration to make the website design more unique to OG. A good illustration of this would be how the 'Table of Contents' section consists of animated playing cards; much like the ones seen on a gambling website. In continuation, creating a storyboard, and filming and editing the video for the portfolio tapped into my passion and expressiveness of cinematography which was something I was not expecting when beginning this coursework.",
					'In conclusion, I have learned noticeable lessons in this 13-week course adventure. Firstly, creating a precise outline helps in time management, understanding roles, and minimising stress levels. Secondly, carefully reading sources and comprising relevant arguments is key to a decisive argument. Thirdly, allowing the flow of unique and creative ideas generates a piece of work that is more personal and meaningful that one can be proud of. This course has assisted in the improvement of my writing and social skills and has helped me widen my knowledge about the capabilities of IT which is vital in my journey through software engineering.'

					'As I look back on the journey of the assignment, I am filled with insights that have shaped both my understanding of the subject and my approach to academic tasks, despite the challenges faced. The written response, research paper and portfolio became transformative experiences, pushing me to explore new avenues of knowledge and develop crucial skills.',
					'The first task required submitting the written response, and the main challenge was the constraint of expressing my argument within a limit of 320 words, considering all the things to be said about the negative financial consequences of OG (Online Gambling) amongst the youth. Finding the perfect articles for my title was a bit difficult at first since there were few articles directly related to it, even though negative consequences of OG are so common and discussed nowadays. This was also my first time writing a paper and looking for articles on Sunway Library, Google Scholar, or any other platforms. For the research paper, after discussing with my teammates, I was assigned to write the main point on negative financial consequences of OG and the counterargument. So far, the latter was the most challenging task since I had no idea what I was going to convey. Subsequently, reading both the articles that I have chosen and the ones my team members helped me gather, I was finally able to grasp the situation and produce some points. At last, the portfolio was the most creative thing we have done for the assignment. One of my partners chose to code the whole portfolio from scratch, which allowed us to express our ideas the way we really wanted to.',
					"However, at first, I could not understand why that for a Bachelor's in Computer Science, we had to attend English classes. Even though General Paper used to be one of my favourite subjects in A-Levels, having English for my first semester was not what I expected and wanted. As we were moving forward, I could figure out that the subject was important and helped by exposing us to the world of researching and writing, at a higher level.",
					'Consequently, throughout my journey, from the written response to the portfolio, in every step of the way, I was able to learn new things leading to an opportunity for further growth. Overall, it has been a supercalifragilisticexpialidocious experience.'
